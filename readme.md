## the data files

Each of the following provides an array of objects:

-   dotaHeroes.js - array of objects, each describing a video game character (found data from the popular video game: DOTA, [here](https://github.com/pydota2/Dota2-JSONData/))
-   elements.js - all the elements from the periodic table. found [here](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/science/elements.json)
-   simpsons.js - all the simpsons episodes. from [tvmaze, here](https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/83/episodes)
-   hiragana.js - japanese hiragana characters and their english pronunciation. (converted from wikipedia article)

## the array methods we'll look at in first session

-   find: returns one element or undefined

-   filter: returns new array of same element type (zero or more. never undefined)

-   some: returns true or false

-   every: returns true or false

-   map: returns a new array, the same size, but with potentially "converted" elements
